# üå≤ Forest-Carbon-Sequestration-Models üåç

## üìú Introduction

This repository contains the research and models from the paper **"Forest-Carbon-Sequestration-Models"**. The study explores sustainable forest management strategies to maximize carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and ecological benefits. It uses advanced modeling techniques like **Richards Equation**, **Logistic Growth Curve**, and **LSTM Neural Networks**.

## üå≥ Features

- **Carbon Sequestration Models:** Analyze and predict forest carbon storage over time.
- **Forest Management Strategies:** Optimize logging cycles, tree species, and reforestation plans.
- **Application:** Case study on Shenandoah National Park, predicting carbon fixation over 100 years.
- **Multi-Objective Analysis:** Balancing ecological, economic, and social benefits.

## üöÄ Key Models and Methods

### 1. Tree Height and Growth Models
- **Richards Equation:** Models tree height growth with age.
- **Logistic Growth Curve:** Predicts tree population distribution by age.

### 2. Carbon Sequestration Models
- Calculates carbon storage per cubic meter.
- Analyzes the relationship between tree density and carbon fixation efficiency.

### 3. Multi-Objective Forest Management
- **AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process):** Balances biodiversity, economic value, and carbon storage.
- **Optimal Logging Strategies:** Determines logging cycles, tree ages, and reforestation plans.

### 4. Case Study: Shenandoah National Park
- Predicted carbon fixation for 100 years using **LSTM Neural Networks** and **Logistic Growth Curve**.
