# 🌲 Forest-Carbon-Sequestration-Models 🌍

## 📜 Introduction

This repository contains the research and models from the paper **"Forest-Carbon-Sequestration-Models"**. The study explores sustainable forest management strategies to maximize carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and ecological benefits. It uses advanced modeling techniques like **Richards Equation**, **Logistic Growth Curve**, and **LSTM Neural Networks**.

## 🌳 Features

- **Carbon Sequestration Models:** Analyze and predict forest carbon storage over time.
- **Forest Management Strategies:** Optimize logging cycles, tree species, and reforestation plans.
- **Application:** Case study on Shenandoah National Park, predicting carbon fixation over 100 years.
- **Multi-Objective Analysis:** Balancing ecological, economic, and social benefits.
